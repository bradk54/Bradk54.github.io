    <h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I’m Brad Kittrell, a passionate and self-motivated data scientist with a rich background in the energy sector. My journey into data science is somewhat unconventional but deeply rewarding. Without the formal confines of a traditional degree in data science, my path has been carved out through real-world experiences, self-directed learning, and a relentless pursuit of understanding. That's resulted in a wide array of experience in the field. Exposure to a massive time-series dataset in my professional work sparked my initial interest. From there, I expanded my knowledge and crafted projects ranging from classification, to regression, and forecasting. These projects have ranged from simple analysis reported to chief engineers and executives, to small team usage analytics and full-scale deployments.</p>

    <h2 class="title">My Background</h2>
      <p>Believe it or not, I got my start in construction, which mostly revolved around the energy sector. I then secured a position at Con Edison and haven't looked back. I've worked in both the transmission and distribution portions of the electrical systems. During my tenure as an engineering supervisor, I was exposed to quite a few big data problems, and that's where my love of data kicked in.</p>
      <p>Prior to professional work, I earned a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University at Buffalo and an MBA from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill while at Con Edison.</p>

    <h2 class="title">Experience</h2>
    <div class="experience-item">
      <h3>Technical</h3>
      <p>A bulk of my experience is with time-series data. I have vast experience dealing with cleaning the data, preparing it for consumer viewing, and preparing for model usage. Two of my recent projects are below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>I deployed a maintenance classification model against 44,000 assets, which frees up around $80,000 in O&M expenses annually. This model was trained using engineering expertise and is integrated with an internal product.</li>
        <li>My group did a huge collaboration with one of our service providers to forecast equipment overloads. My deployed model achieved greater than 0.70 precision on its validation set.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <h3>Leadership</h3>
    <ul>
      <p>I bridge a lot of domain expertise between my analytics departments and our customers, who can range from business groups to engineers. So, speaking their language is critical, and I find ways to properly convey problems and ideas. I once gave a tutorial on machine learning to over 50 utility engineers on a call and was told "that's the gold standard" for conveying that topic.</p>

    <h2 class = "title">Looking Forward</h2>
      <p>As I continue my career, I am eager to leverage my unique blend of industry knowledge and data science skills to tackle new challenges. I am particularly interested in projects that lie at the intersection of data science and renewable energy, aiming to contribute to the advancement of sustainable and efficient energy solutions. Of course I am always intersted in entering new fields and sectors; bringing my unique domain expertise to them.</p>
      <p>I desire to have the opportunity to run my own Data Science team which brings value and understanding to a customer.</p>
    </div>

  <h2 class = "title">Lets Connect</h2>
  <p>
    I am always looking to connect with like-minded professionals and explore potential collaborations. Whether you’re interested in discussing the future of utilities and data science, or simply wish to exchange ideas, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn.
