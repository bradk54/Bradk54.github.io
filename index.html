    <h2 class="title">About Me</h2>
      <p>Hello! I’m Brad Kittrell, a passionate and self-motivated data scientist with a rich background in the energy sector. My journey into data science is somewhat unconventional but deeply rewarding. Without the formal confines of a traditional degree in data science, my path has been carved out through real-world experiences, self-directed learning, and a relentless pursuit of understanding. Thats resulted in a wide array of experience in the field. In my professional work I have worked on projects ranging from classification, to regression and forecasting. And those projects have ranged from simple analysis reported to chief engineers and exeuctives, small team usage analytics and full scale deployments.</p>

    <h2 class="title">My Background</h2>
      <p>Believe or not I got my start in construction which mostly revolved around the energy sector. I then secured a position in Con Edison and haven't looked back. I've worked in both the transmission and distribution portions of the electrical systems. During tensure as an engineering supervisor i was exposed to quite a few big data problems and thats where my love of data kicked in. </p>
      <p>Prior to profession work I got a Bachelors of Science in Electrical Engineering from the Univeristy at Buffalo. And got my MBA from the University of North Carolina Chapel Hill while at Con Edison</p>
